In today's video, we're talking about 15 ways that you can go about automating your Gmail account, hopefully winning back so much time. Personally, I use pretty much every single one of these, or at least the vast, vast majority of these, every single day. I can't tell you how big of a quality of life increase this has been for me, and I'm sure that you'll find value in this as well. Let's get into this. We are using n8n to automate pretty much everything in this video. And the first thing I'm going to do is start off with the really basic things in order to set you up for success. And then we're going to be progressively working our way through more complicated things. And so most of the time the backbone of automating things in Gmail is waiting for emails to come in because when an email comes in, we might want to do things like automatically label that email. We might want to automatically reply to that email or forward that email to somebody else. And so for that reason, the first thing that I want to start off with inside n8n is the Gmail trigger. So we'll click plus here, search for Gmail, and we'll notice that there is one particular trigger here, which is when we receive a message in Gmail. Now, the first thing is is that we will actually go ahead, fetch a response to see if anything loads in here, which fortunately it does. Now, the only problem with this particular response that it gave back is that it's hiding a lot of critical data that we need. And one of those important pieces is the text of the particular email. So, if I was to go into this email, we'll see that this is the text here. And fortunately, we can see that in this snippet, it has received this, but the snippet is a bit, uh, problematic because this only loads in like, I don't know, maybe like 100 characters. It's kind of like the preview to the email that you see. And so if your email is very long, okay, if unless just go into the promotions tab, which is like the deepest crevice of my Gmail inbox that I never go to. I'm going to go to this one. This is a long email, lots of text, not all of this is going to be covered in the particular snippet here. And so we actually have to get all of the information how we do that is through this simplify, uh, modu or node here. So we're going to uncheck this and then we can fetch in response again. And now we have access to everything else like the text down here and like just tons of other information. And so that is point number one. Point number two is that in Gmail, one of my favorite functions is the Gmail search function up here. Like we can actually search for things that we want up here and the filter works quite well. We have access to that directly inside n8n as well. And we can use this filter here. So we'll add a filter. Usually this is going to be a search filter, which is essentially the one-to-one equivalent to this search filter up top here. And we can more or less filter just like we do inside Gmail as well. We check, if we click this more info button here, it's going to send us to a link of all of the different filters that we can provide to this n8n trigger. So some of the more common ones are like things like file name. So I use this all the time. Maybe you want to find just PDF documents. This is a great use case for that. A lot of the times I want to find things that are just based on the subject line. So maybe I want to find just new leads for instance coming in here. You can see there's lots of new leads coming in here. I could filter based on the subject line, new lead. So in fact, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to do that, uh, for this particular instance here. So subject line is new lead. We can fetch the test event and now it's going to bypass any email until it finds the most recent instance of, uh, of this new lead. And that I guess to like this is happening pretty much in real time. So it's just going to pull in the last email. Uh, but it's only going to pull it in if it's a new lead email. Awesome. The next thing is is that we can auto label emails. Let me kind of demonstrate what this looks like. We have labels over here. You can categorize all of the incoming emails in your Gmail account. You can create as many labels as you want. And then once you create these labels, we can create a workflow like this, which seems a bit overwhelming at a glance, but is quite simple because it's really every single one of these paths here are more or less the exact same thing. We're just categorizing emails. At least this is what I use. I categorize things into certain labels, promotions, social, personal, sales, recruitment, accounting, Google calendar, community, and so on and so forth. And so that is how I personally do it and we can simply do the same thing as well. So we can hit a plus button here and we can do text classifier. What the text classifier does is it will classify the text coming in or in other words, it will categorize it for you so that when you have an email coming in like, for instance, this new lead email right here, we can categorize this as for instance a new lead or if it's something else, we can categorize it however we want to. So what I like to pass in here is typically two values. The first value is the subject line, and the second value is the text of the email which is right here. So we can pass in both of these fields here, and we'll just add in some additional context here. So I'll call this the subject line and then I'll call this the email body. And now that we passed this in, we just need to define which paths to take people down. And so we could define different classification for all these labels. I'm just going to keep it simple for this video. I'm going to do primary promotion and social. I have another video like this where I give this exact, well this more or less this whole system away for free in another video if you guys want I'll link that down below for you guys to take a look at. But more or less we have these categories. We'll add in three for now. One will be the primary category. One will be the social category and the last one will be the promotions category. And so I want to just kind of touch on this because I think this is really important. I see a lot of people struggling with adding the description in here. More or less in a nutshell, I find that less is often more when it comes to adding in a description of this. The description you use here is going to allow the AI to know whether or not this email should be tagged, for instance, as primary, social, and promotions. So we need to define exactly what a primary social and promotions email is. And again, this is just an example. We could use this for all the labels here as well. And when I say less is more, I just mean that like usually if I find that when people start, they'll add in and this includes myself as well. I added in a lot of stuff and then it started conflicting with the other labels and then it started mislabeling them and it just created a lot of problems for me. So I like to add in less. So I'm just going to type in here, anything that is a personal message, such as an email from a friend or family members. Okay, so we have that. We can do the same thing for the social here. So we'll say anything that is a social message such as an email notification from Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube. And then we'll copy this and do the promotional email as well. So anything that is a promotional message such as a discount email promotion or anything from an e-commerce brand. Okay, perfect. And there we go. We now have three categories. We could also add a catch all here, so this could be like miscellaneous and this could be anything that does not fall into any of the other categories. And so, that way we have a catch all here. Now, just before we test this out, we do need to add a model here because you can see it's like, it's not happy. We have this red ring around this. So, we need to add a large language model. I'm going to use ChatGPT here. And specifically I'm going to use the model 4.0 mini. Now, if you guys are brand new, and sorry for anyone who's watching this and hears me say this like a broken record, but in a nutshell, if you guys haven't done so already, you're going to have to head over to platform.openai.com, create an account. Once you've logged into your account, you're going to need to get the API token. So, when we more or less create a credential here, we're going to need an API token. We get that by going into the settings here, API keys, and then creating something. And we'll have to add a balance of $5 in order for this to work properly. Otherwise, you're not going to be able to use ChatGPT inside an add-on. And so, there we have it. We've now classified the text, and based on this, it will route it into one of those four options, primary, social, promotions, or miscellaneous. And the last thing that we need to do in order to get these auto labels up and running is we'll add another module here, which is Gmail. And I'm going to type in label, which will be adding a label to a message as that message comes in. And we can choose the label down here. Now, just before we actually run this or before we finish this, we don't have any input data. So, I'm going to exit out of this, hide the module here, and run this so that we can pull in some test data. And now, I'm going to go in and pin this initial trigger message just so we have this so we can constantly re use that same email instead of having to like wait for emails to come in every time which can be quite annoying if you don't have any new emails in your inbox. So we're going to come back here, activate it. And now we have access to all the state on the side. We need two things, message ID and label names. So the message ID, if we go over to the schema up top here, and we can choose this ID from the text classifier. I usually like pulling it from the original trigger, but these are the exact same thing, so you can pull it from either or. And then we'll just choose the category that we want to, which in this instance is going to be category personal. And we'll do this for the next two as well. We can duplicate this by hitting command D twice and looks like these have been duplicated way far outside the actual scenario here. So we'll drag them down. And we'll finish this off. So one will be promotional and one will be social. Awesome. I like to just label these properly, otherwise it can get pretty confusing. So one will be personal, the other will be social. And we can change the label here to social. And lastly, this will be promotional over here. Okay. And so, in a nutshell, we've finished the auto labeling. This will work like a charm. It will automatically receive all emails coming in and it'll label them uh according to your particular Gmail account, whether it's primary, promotional, social, or any of the labels on the side here, which I think is really nice. Kind of following through with this, what I like what I try to do is the project and this is the next tip here, is the project zero inbox where essentially everything coming into your inbox just gets automatically routed to these labels. And so you can 100% do that. You could literally have this inbox here as like clean. It says the like no new emails being recorded, which is honestly I think is a beautiful site. We can go ahead and we can just delete these. This is kind of this is beautiful to me. I love that look. It's just it's just it just really helps with my anxiety knowing that there's like nothing there. But ultimately at the end of the day, while it is nice to do that, the thing is is like I don't want to push all of my emails out of sight because if it's out of sight, it's out of mind. And the problem is is that if it's out of mind, then I'm not going to actually get around to replying to them. And so any critical emails I want in the inbox and any emails that are not critical, I do not want in the inbox, which brings us to the next point here, which is a lot of the emails that I get, such as the promotional and social tab and half of the things in my primary inbox are junk and I never have to even take a look at. This is like a rabbit hole of emails that I've never looked at in my entire life. I have no intention of looking at and so I just want to get rid of these emails ASAP. And how we can do that is we can set up another node here. This is going to be a Gmail node and we can mark it as unread. So, we'll type in unread, mark a message as unread. We'll select this and we just need to pass in that proper message ID which is going to be the Gmail trigger ID over here. And now, anytime this runs, it will mark this as red, only if it's a social email or if it's a now promotional email. So in either instance, it's going to mark it as red. You can take it a step further and you can go to Gmail and you could delete this as well. However, I just will caution you that before deleting this particular message, I would run with marking it as unread first, and only when you're super happy with the results, then you can turn on the deletion because you probably want to avoid having certain emails routed incorrectly and then deleting actually important emails by mistake. So before you encounter any errors, just make sure that it's working properly, and then after it's working the way it's intended to work, then you can go ahead and delete things as automatically. Now, the next thing that I want to talk about here is we can uh supercharge our Gmail inbox and auto reply or we can create draft responses to particular emails as they're coming in. And so we have this particular email here. Well, this is not the best use case scenario because obviously we don't want to reply to like some auto responder here. But we could respond to for instance personal emails as they come through. And so how we would go about doing this is we'd add another node here and in this node we would choose open AI. And so with open AI, we'll select message a model and this model here is going to reply to this person for us or at least generate the response for us. And so there's a couple of things we need to do here. First of all, we need to actually choose the model. I like to use 4.1 Mini just because this is like the newer version of one of the newer models in open AI. It has less it's faster and it's more intelligent than the other mini series like mini 40 mini. Now I'm going to open this up. We have three messages. We have system and I just want to repeat this one more time because this is so important. We have three messages. The first message is the system message which is the context. It's providing information on what Chat GPT is supposed to do. So in this instance, it's like saying, hey, you're supposed to take information like first name, last name, email and so on and pull it out of text. Okay, so that's the system message. The user message is essentially the input here saying, this is the text that you're pulling information out of, which is this email up top here. The last one is the assistant message, which is the response. We need to define how we want this response to look. We want it to be structured data. So we're pulling out from this text over here, we're pulling data out of text and structuring it in the form of JSON data. What JSON data is is everything over here on the left hand side, input side. This is the backbone of N and so we need to structure it in JSON format. So let's go ahead and circle through this. We're going to say, you're an intelligent bot capable of pulling out information from an email, such as first name, last name, email, and budget. and with that spelling mistake, that's fine. It should be able to understand properly. with the prompts here, we're going to put in the message which will be this text message here. Here's the email message to pull out information from. Okay, perfect. Now, this is the this is the tricky part. This is the most important thing. We need to identify JSON data. How we do that is if you're not familiar with JSON data, no worries, you don't have to code it. You just have to go to chat GPT, and we're going to take we're going to ask Chat GPT to create us this JSON data. And so how we ask it to do this, we're going to say, please generate me JSON data, um, please generate me sample JSON data for the following things, and in this example, we're going to do first name, last name, email, and budget, but you can put in any fields you want to extract. I'm going to say, make sure they're all text fields. and in a nutshell, it's all text fields because we're going to enter them into Google Sheets here. All of these are going to be text fields. Now, you don't have to have it as all text fields, but that's what I'm going to do. Uh, the last thing here, and when I say not all text fields, I just mean like depending on your use case, you might actually need this in different data types, but text is the most simple data type. So we're going to do one last thing, we're going to say please do not put in any answers, leave the answers blank. And so it's going to take or strip out all of this data so that it's just empty. We can copy this and in our prompt here, all we need to do is paste it in and say one thing at the top, please output the data as JSON data with the following structure. And so this is boilerplate. Everything here that I just wrote, you just write the same thing every time if you want to follow the structure, and you just you just need to identify to ChatGPT that it needs to be JSON data, otherwise it'll throw an error. The reason why is because we need to output the content as JSON. I'm going to leave this unchecked for now to show you the difference between the two. But essentially, the difference is is that in this instance, it's outputting it as text and we know it's text because it has these quotations around it. Anytime there's quotations, it's text, but this is no different than the data that we got here. So it doesn't really help us out. But the second we change this to output as JSON, now it flipped it so that we have first name Sandy, last name Anderson, email Sandy@gmail.com, budget $200. And now we can add this into our Google sheet here and add in the particular values for the corresponding headers here. So we'll go ahead, we'll do that. We'll append row in sheet, which just means adding to the spreadsheet. We're going to choose this untitled spreadsheet. I probably should have named this first, but that's okay. And we'll choose the tab that we're going to enter data into, which is sheet number one down here. And we can just drag and drop the information in. So first name, last name, email, and budget. Perfect. We'll go ahead, give this a shot. It's pulling up the information in real time. It's going to add it in to this particular Google spreadsheet. And so that is how we can pull out data from emails, like unstructured data like lead data here, how we can pull it out of PDF files automatically, all that kind of stuff. Just a couple last things here before we wrap up. One other thing that you could do is let's say you have all of these leads coming in and you want to summarize these every single day, week, month, whatever the case may be. We can go ahead and do that by creating a new workflow here. I'm going to hide this workflow. We're going to add another trigger here and this trigger is going to be on a schedule. And you can choose whichever schedule, maybe once every day, once every week, once every month. For this instance, I'm just going to choose every day. And we want to pull out all of these particular leads for the day and we want to send that to myself or to yourself via Slack every single day or email or whatever. And so we'll hit the plus button. We'll search for Gmail. And this time I want to get many messages. So now we're pulling out many different emails from this inbox here. We're pulling out however many you define. You could return all, you could limit it to 50. We want to make sure that we uncheck simplified so that we can pull in the text body of these emails as well. And apart from that, I just want to add in a filter by search which is subject equals new lead. We don't want to pull in all emails here. For instance, I don't want to pull in this test invoice. I just want to summarize all of these particular leads here. So we're going to go ahead do that. Run this and we would pull in six leads here. Now, what we could do is we could take these leads and we could send them in a message. The only problem is is that we have six leads and if I add a slack message, this will send off six slack messages. It won't send off one message with six leads. It'll send off six messages with six individual leads. And so just like it says here, this has run one time. Now we've retrieved six leads and we're running them individually. We need to merge these together into one message. And so how we do that is through something called an aggregator. And what an aggregator does is it takes these individual leads and aggregates them together in one particular message. And I think it's best if I just actually write this down on this blackboard here because it's this is like kind of getting into software engineering slash you know a bit more advanced stuff. This is you, you're going to the grocery store. Okay, and in the grocery store, you have a list of things to buy. One is bananas. Number two is mangoes. And number three is apples. And you might be thinking, why the hell are you talking about a grocery store? Why the hell are you talking about a grocery list? Like how does this have any bearing? This is a list and a list is a fancy way of saying or is a simple way of saying array. And inside n8n, you have different data types. One is text. This is like a text field here. And you can have a list of multiple things. So that list could be a grocery store list here. It could be a list of your grocery items, bananas, mangoes, apples. You can also have a list of leads. You can have Stacy as a new lead, Bob is a new lead, Sarah is a new lead. You have a list of leads here. And so essentially how these lists work is very similarly to how you'd go to a grocery store. When you enter this store, you're not going to start likely with apples. You're going to start at the top of the list. and you're not going to move to mangoes or apples until you've crossed off the first thing on the list. So you're not going to go to mangoes until bananas is done. And only once bananas is checked off, then you go to mangoes. But you're not going to go to apples yet until mangoes is done. And only once mangoes is checked off, then you go to apples and so on and so forth until your your whole list has been completed. And why I say this is that array aggregators work in the same way. We're not going to continue past this until we've gone through all six leads and added them into this list. So we can go ahead, we can test this out. And we've got six leads that are now merged into one list. If we open this up, well, we'll see nothing happened here. And that is because we didn't add in the field that we want to merge, which is this test field. But if we run this again, now we have a list of six people here. And so this is still a list, keep in mind. An array aggregator hasn't changed like it's still a list of six leads, but it's no longer sending six messages. It's now sending one message at a time. And so we could send a slack message here. Okay, so send a message. Send a message. And now we can include in here, I'm just going to message myself for instance. I could send myself a message with all of these leads. So let's just see if it sends it. So you can see it's not like structured properly. So this isn't ideal. How we could change that is we could do like set or edit fields here. And we could do lead report. This name is arbitrary. You can call it whatever it is you want. We can pass this text field in here, and we'll change it to a string. And when we output this, it's going to look something like this. Again, this is not a beautiful list by any means. This is not something I'd send myself, but I just don't want to spend too much time in the weeds kind of doing something that I don't really perceive as like on track for this video. And so for that reason, I'm just going to leave it at that. But in a nutshell, you could grab all the list, all the leads, merge into a list, structure that list properly, send yourself over a message and here is that message over here with all of that information in one place at one time. And that's pretty useful to have if you want to pull out reports from your inbox. The next thing that I want to talk about is less of an automation and more of something that I recently started doing that was fundamentally game-changing. Honestly, it might be more beneficial than almost everything else that I'm talking about here. So I wanted to point this out. If you go into the settings section of Google Gmail and we see all settings and we hover over to the accounts and imports. We have this grant access to your account. This, you can essentially, you can give access to a virtual assistant, you can give access to your personal assistant or a member of your team to actually go through your Gmail and clean up everything, respond to people, all of that kind of stuff. And this has been something that has saved me so much time and I am very thankful that I did it. Another thing that you could do is you could add like labels here for instance, like you could add a label for your personal assistant to go through and have tasks or emails assigned to them. And if we go back into our particular scenario here, you could add another text classifier for that specific person and start assigning things directly to them. Lastly and finally what we're going to cover today is just circling back to this Gmail trigger here. This Gmail trigger is something called a poll. Now, inside n8n, I just want to define what a poll is because I think that this is incredibly useful to know. And if you don't know this, you're going to, uh, not be happy with n8n. So this on one side is n8n, and on the other side we have Gmail over here. This mic is kind of like inconveniently placed. Now, what happens with a poll is that in n8n, it will send a request over to Gmail and it will say, hey, do you have a new email? Is there an email that exists? And if there is an email, it'll say, yes, we have an email and it'll return that email back. But if it doesn't have an email, it will not return that. So let's say that you send a request to Gmail, there's no new emails. You've searched for all the emails, there's nothing new. It's going to say, hey, you're there's nothing new. Um, but if there is an email, it'll send it back. But in either instance, you're still having to pay for one operation, which means you are on the hook for paying it regardless of the outcome. Why that's problematic is because if you poll, which is requesting information at a specific interval, if you pull once every minute, in a given day, you would send 1,440 requests. This is a lot of requests because in your n8n account, you only have, if you're starting out on the cloud, 2,500 requests, which means you're going to go through this in like literally 1.5 days, and you're going to spend $25, uh, $25 USD or euros or whatever per month on something that's going to expire in like a day and a half. And so this is not ideal. So then the question becomes, well, how can you get around this? Like, how can we work around this? So if we go to n8n's pricing, we go to the pricing page, they have this starter, which most people are going to start out on when they're trying out n8n, but this again limits us to 2.5k. We can self-host, which is free with an asterisk, using this community edition, and this takes two to three minutes to set up. Here's two examples. I use hostinger.com. And we can go to hostinger n8n. And this is an option that you can set it up in two to three minutes. You're paying less than n8n, and you bypass this whole thing. You you don't have to worry about these limitations. The last one is elestio n8n hosting, which is very similar. You can set it up in a matter of a couple minutes here. Um, the only benefit to this that Hostinger doesn't have is that with Hostinger, you have to pay up front right away for this. With elestio, you only have to pay for what you use, which could be a lot more economical if you're not using n8n all that much. And so for that reason, you can bypass these particular limitations, which is the polling every minute. Like, you you could set this for every day or every hour, but I just get like probably hundreds of emails a day personally, and I want to clear these ASAP. I don't want them building up. So I want this triggering more often than not. And if you're like me, you'll probably want a higher frequency, but you're going to run into that limitation with the plans here. And to overcome that, yeah, you'll just need to sign up for self-hosting, which I also have a video on in my, uh, on my YouTube channel, absolutely for free for you guys to watch. But these are the two options. You can also choose Railway n8n hosting as well. This is a one-click install. Those are three options that, uh, that you could run with right now. Um, but that is it in a nutshell, guys. Thank you so much for watching. I hope you found value in this video. If you did, make sure to hit that subscribe button down below because I'm sure if you like this video, you'll probably like the other videos that are released all the time as well. And if you want to learn more about AI automation, I would take a, recommend taking a look at my school community here, where I help people just like yourself automate, uh, their entire business and help them make money with AI automation. So, in a nutshell, there's two transformations I try and take people on in this community. Number one is helping people automate up to 80% of their business. I just give away the exact blueprints that I use to scale my business to seven figures and automate pretty much myself out of a job. And then lastly, it's to help people, um, actually create and scale an AI automation agency. Apart from that, there's tons of other unreleased videos on here that I don't go into on YouTube. Um, and these are probably the blueprints that, uh, have been the biggest mover and shakers for me, the ones that actually save me the most time and earn me the most money. And so that is it in a nutshell. Thanks guys so much. Hope you have a lovely day and I look forward to seeing you guys in the next video. Thanks so much. Bye bye.

在今天的视频中，我们将讨论 15 种可以自动化你的 Gmail 账户的方法，希望能为你赢回大量时间。我个人几乎每天都在使用这些方法中的每一种，或者至少是绝大多数。我无法告诉你这对我的生活质量有多大的提升，我相信你也会从中发现价值。让我们开始吧。我们正在使用 n8n 来自动化本视频中的几乎所有内容。我要做的第一件事是从非常基础的东西开始，以便为你成功做好准备。然后我们将逐步处理更复杂的事情。所以，大多数时候，自动化 Gmail 的核心是等待邮件的到来，因为当一封邮件进来时，我们可能想做一些事情，比如自动给那封邮件贴上标签。我们可能想自动回复那封邮件或者把那封邮件转发给别人。因此，我想在 n8n 中开始的第一件事就是 Gmail 触发器。所以我们点击这里的加号，搜索 Gmail，我们会注意到这里有一个特定的触发器，那就是当我们在 Gmail 中收到一封邮件时。现在，第一件事是，我们实际上会去获取一个响应，看看是否有任何东西加载进来，幸运的是，它确实加载了。现在，这个特定的响应返回的唯一问题是，它隐藏了我们需要的很多关键数据。其中一个重要的部分是特定邮件的文本。所以，如果我进入这封邮件，我们会看到这是这里的文本。幸运的是，我们可以看到在这个片段中，它已经收到了这个，但是这个片段有点问题，因为它只加载了大约，我不知道，也许像 100 个字符。它有点像你看到的邮件预览。所以如果你的邮件很长，好的，如果除非我们进入促销标签，这就像我 Gmail 收件箱里我从不去的最深的角落。我要去看这个。这是一封很长的邮件，有很多文字，并不是所有这些都会被这个特定的片段覆盖。所以我们实际上必须获取所有的信息，我们怎么做呢？就是通过这个简化，呃，模块或者节点。所以我们要取消勾选这个，然后我们可以再次获取响应。现在我们可以访问所有其他东西，比如这里的文本，以及大量的其他信息。所以这是第一点。第二点是，在 Gmail 中，我最喜欢的功能之一是这里的 Gmail 搜索功能。就像我们可以实际搜索我们想要的东西，而且这个过滤器工作得很好。我们也可以直接在 n8n 内部访问它。我们可以使用这个过滤器。所以我们会添加一个过滤器。通常这会是一个搜索过滤器，它基本上是与上面这个搜索过滤器一对一等效的。我们或多或少可以像在 Gmail 内部一样进行过滤。我们检查，如果我们点击这个更多信息按钮，它会把我们带到一个链接，上面有我们可以提供给这个 n8n 触发器的所有不同过滤器。所以一些更常见的，比如文件名。我一直用这个。也许你想只找 PDF 文档。这是一个很好的用例。很多时候，我想找那些只基于主题行的东西。所以也许我想只找新的潜在客户，比如这里进来的。你可以看到有很多新的潜在客户进来。我可以根据主题行“新潜在客户”进行过滤。所以实际上，我将要这样做，呃，在这个特定的实例中。所以主题行是“新潜在客户”。我们可以获取测试事件，现在它会绕过任何邮件，直到找到这个新潜在客户的最新实例。我想这就像，这是几乎实时发生的。所以它只会拉取最后一封邮件。呃，但它只有在是新潜在客户邮件时才会拉取。太棒了。下一件事是我们可以自动给邮件贴标签。让我来演示一下这是什么样子。我们这里有标签。你可以对 Gmail 账户中所有收到的邮件进行分类。你可以创建任意多的标签。然后，一旦你创建了这些标签，我们就可以创建一个像这样的工作流，乍一看似乎有点复杂，但其实很简单，因为这里每一条路径基本上都是完全相同的。我们只是在对邮件进行分类。至少我是这么用的。我把事情分类到特定的标签，促销、社交、个人、销售、招聘、会计、谷歌日历、社区等等。这就是我个人的做法，我们也可以简单地做同样的事情。所以我们可以在这里点击一个加号按钮，我们可以做文本分类器。文本分类器的作用是，它会分类收到的文本，换句话说，它会为你分类，这样当你收到一封邮件，比如这封新的潜在客户邮件，我们就可以把它分类为，比如说，一个新的潜在客户，或者如果是别的东西，我们可以按我们想要的方式分类。所以我喜欢在这里传递两个值。第一个值是主题行，第二个值是邮件的文本，就在这里。所以我们可以把这两个字段都传进去，然后我们再加一些额外的上下文。所以我称这个为主题行，然后我称这个为邮件正文。现在我们已经传入了这个，我们只需要定义要把人带到哪条路径上。所以我们可以为所有这些标签定义不同的分类。这个视频我会保持简单。我只做主要、推广和社交。我还有一个像这样的视频，我在另一个视频里免费赠送了这整个系统，如果你想看，我会在下面链接。但或多或少，我们有这些类别。我们现在会添加三个。一个是主要类别。一个是社交类别，最后一个是推广类别。所以我想谈谈这个，因为我觉得这很重要。我看到很多人在添加描述时遇到困难。简单来说，我发现在描述这件事上，少即是多。你在这里使用的描述将让 AI 知道这封邮件是否应该被标记为，例如，主要、社交和推广。所以我们需要准确定义什么是主要、社交和推广邮件。再次强调，这只是一个例子。我们也可以把这个用在所有标签上。当我说少即是多时，我的意思是，通常如果我发现当人们开始时，他们会添加，这也包括我自己。我添加了很多东西，然后它开始与其他标签冲突，然后它开始错误地标记它们，这给我造成了很多问题。所以我喜欢少加点东西。所以我就在这里输入，任何个人信息，比如来自朋友或家人的邮件。好的，我们有了这个。我们可以对社交做同样的事情。所以我们会说任何社交信息，比如来自 Facebook、Instagram 或 YouTube 的邮件通知。然后我们会复制这个，也做推广邮件。所以任何推广信息，比如折扣邮件、推广活动或来自电子商务品牌的任何东西。好的，太棒了。就这样。我们现在有三个类别。我们也可以在这里添加一个“全部捕获”的选项，比如“杂项”，这可以是任何不属于其他类别的东西。这样，我们就有了一个“全部捕获”的选项。现在，在我们测试之前，我们需要在这里添加一个模型，因为你可以看到它就像，它不高兴。我们这里有一个红色的圈。所以，我们需要添加一个大型语言模型。我将使用 ChatGPT。具体来说，我将使用 4.0 mini 模型。现在，如果你是新手，对不起，如果有人看这个视频听到我说这个像复读机一样，但简单来说，如果你还没有这样做，你将需要去 platform.openai.com，创建一个账户。一旦你登录到你的账户，你需要获取 API 令牌。所以，当我们或多或少地在这里创建一个凭证时，我们将需要一个 API 令牌。我们通过进入这里的设置，API 密钥，然后创建一些东西来获得它。我们还需要添加 5 美元的余额，这样才能正常工作。否则，你将无法在附加组件中使用 ChatGPT。所以，就这样。我们现在已经对文本进行了分类，并根据这个，它会把它路由到这四个选项之一，主要、社交、推广或杂项。为了让这些自动标签运行起来，我们最后需要做的是在这里添加另一个模块，就是 Gmail。我输入“标签”，这将是给一条消息添加标签，当那条消息进来时。我们可以在这里选择标签。现在，在我们实际运行这个之前，或者在我们完成这个之前，我们没有任何输入数据。所以，我将退出这个，隐藏这个模块，然后运行这个，以便我们可以拉入一些测试数据。现在，我将进入并固定这个初始触发器消息，这样我们就有这个，以便我们可以不断地重复使用同一封邮件，而不必每次都等待邮件进来，如果你收件箱里没有任何新邮件，这可能会很烦人。所以我们要回到这里，激活它。现在我们可以访问侧边的所有状态。我们需要两样东西，消息 ID 和标签名称。消息 ID，如果我们转到上面的模式，我们可以从文本分类器中选择这个 ID。我通常喜欢从原始触发器中获取它，但它们是完全相同的东西，所以你可以从任何一个获取。然后我们只需选择我们想要的类别，在这个实例中是个人类别。然后我们对接下来两个也这样做。我们可以通过按 command D 两次来复制这个，看起来这些被复制到了实际场景之外很远的地方。所以我们把它们拖下来。然后我们完成这个。所以一个是推广，一个是社交。太棒了。我喜欢把这些标签正确地标记，否则会很混乱。所以一个是个人，另一个是社交。我们可以把这里的标签改成社交。最后，这个是推广。好的。所以，总而言之，我们完成了自动标记。这会像魔术一样工作。它会自动接收所有进来的邮件，并根据你的特定 Gmail 账户给它们贴上标签，无论是主要、推广、社交，还是侧边的任何标签，我觉得这很好。接着说，我喜欢或者我尝试做的是项目，这是下一个技巧，是项目零收件箱，基本上所有进入你收件箱的东西都会自动路由到这些标签。所以你完全可以这样做。你可以让这个收件箱像这样干净。它显示的是，比如没有新邮件被记录，说实话，我觉得这是一个美丽的景象。我们可以继续，我们可以删除这些。这对我来说很美。我喜欢那种感觉。它只是，它只是真的有助于缓解我的焦虑，知道那里没有任何东西。但最终，虽然这样做很好，但问题是，我不想把我所有的邮件都推到看不见的地方，因为眼不见心不烦。问题是，如果我看不见，我就不会记得去回复它们。所以任何重要的邮件我都想放在收件箱里，任何不重要的邮件我都不想放在收件箱里，这就引出了下一点，那就是我收到的很多邮件，比如推广和社交标签，以及我主要收件箱里一半的东西都是垃圾，我根本不需要看。这就像一个我一生中从未去过的 Gmail 收件箱的兔子洞。我打算去看这个。这是一封很长的邮件，有很多文字，并不是所有这些都会被这个特定的片段覆盖。所以我想尽快摆脱这些邮件。我们怎么做呢？我们可以设置另一个节点。这将是一个 Gmail 节点，我们可以把它标记为未读。所以，我们输入未读，把一条消息标记为未读。我们选择这个，我们只需要传入那个正确的消息 ID，这将是这里的 Gmail 触发器 ID。现在，每当这个运行时，它会把这个标记为已读，只有当它是社交邮件或者现在是推广邮件时。所以在任何一种情况下，它都会把它标记为已读。你可以更进一步，你可以去 Gmail，你也可以删除这个。但是，我只是要提醒你，在删除这个特定消息之前，我建议先运行把它标记为未读，只有当你对结果非常满意时，你才能打开删除功能，因为你可能想避免某些邮件被错误地路由，然后错误地删除了实际上很重要的邮件。所以，在遇到任何错误之前，只要确保它工作正常，然后在它按预期工作后，你就可以自动删除东西了。现在，我想谈的下一件事是，我们可以，呃，给我们的 Gmail 收件箱加点料，自动回复，或者我们可以为特定的邮件创建草稿回复，当它们进来的时候。所以我们有这封特定的邮件。嗯，这不是最好的用例场景，因为显然我们不想回复像自动回复器这样的东西。但我们可以回复，比如说，个人邮件，当它们进来的时候。所以我们怎么做呢？我们会在这里添加另一个节点，在这个节点中，我们会选择 OpenAI。所以有了 OpenAI，我们会选择一个模型，这个模型会为我们回复这个人，或者至少为我们生成回复。所以我们有几件事要做。首先，我们实际上需要选择模型。我喜欢用 4.0 Mini，只是因为这是 OpenAI 中更新的模型之一。它更少，更快，比其他迷你系列，比如 40 迷你，更智能。现在我要打开这个。我们有三条消息。我们有系统，我只想再重复一次，因为这很重要。我们有三条消息。第一条是系统消息，也就是上下文。它提供了关于 ChatGPT 应该做什么的信息。所以在这个实例中，它就像说，嘿，你应该提取像名字、姓氏、电子邮件等信息，并从文本中提取出来。好的，这就是系统消息。用户消息基本上是这里的输入，说这是你要从中提取信息的文本，也就是上面的这封电子邮件。最后一个是助手消息，也就是响应。我们需要定义我们希望这个响应是什么样子。我们希望它是结构化数据。所以我们从这里的文本中提取数据，并把它构造成 JSON 数据的形式。什么是 JSON 数据呢？就是左边的输入侧。这是 N 的骨架，所以我们需要把它构造成 JSON 格式。所以让我们开始，遍历这个。我们会说，你是一个能够从邮件中提取信息的智能机器人，比如名字、姓氏、电子邮件和预算。而且那个拼写错误没关系。它应该能正确理解。关于这里的提示，我们会输入消息，这将是这个文本消息。这是要从中提取信息的电子邮件。好的，完美。现在，这是棘手的部分。这是最重要的事情。我们需要识别 JSON 数据。我们怎么做呢？如果你不熟悉 JSON 数据，别担心，你不需要编码。你只需要去 chat GPT，然后我们会让 Chat GPT 为我们创建这个 JSON 数据。所以我们怎么让它做呢？我们会说，请为我生成 JSON 数据，嗯，请为我生成以下事物的示例 JSON 数据。在这个例子中，我们要做名字、姓氏、电子邮件和预算，但你可以输入任何你想提取的字段。我要说，确保它们都是文本字段。简单来说，它们都是文本字段，因为我们要把它们输入到 Google Sheets 里。所有这些都是文本字段。现在，你不需要让它们都是文本字段，但我要这么做。呃，最后一件事，当我说不是所有文本字段时，我只是指，比如根据你的用例，你可能实际上需要不同数据类型的数据，但文本是最简单的数据类型。所以我们要做的最后一件事是，我们会说请不要输入任何答案，把答案留空。所以它会提取或剔除所有这些数据，这样它就是空的。我们可以复制这个，在我们的提示中，我们只需要粘贴进去，然后在顶部说一句话，请用以下结构输出数据为 JSON 数据。所以这是样板。我刚才写的这些，如果你想遵循这个结构，你每次都写同样的东西，你只需要向 ChatGPT 识别出它需要是 JSON 数据，否则它会报错。原因是因为我们需要将内容输出为 JSON。我现在先不勾选这个， чтобы показать вам разницу между ними. но по сути, разница в том, что в этом случае он выводит это как текст, и мы знаем, что это текст, потому что у него есть эти кавычки вокруг. в любое время, когда есть кавычки, это текст, но это ничем не отличается от данных, которые мы получили здесь. так что это не очень нам помогает. но как только мы меняем это на вывод как JSON, теперь он поменял это так, что у нас есть имя Сэнди, фамилия Андерсон, электронная почта Sandy@gmail.com, бюджет $200. и теперь мы можем добавить это в наш лист Google здесь и добавить конкретные значения для соответствующих заголовков здесь. поэтому мы сделаем это. мы добавим строку в лист, что просто означает добавление в электронную таблицу. мы выберем эту неименованную электронную таблицу. я, вероятно, должен был назвать это сначала, но это не страшно. и мы выберем вкладку, в которую мы собираемся вводить данные, это лист номер один здесь внизу. и мы можем просто перетащить информацию. так что имя, фамилия, электронная почта и бюджет. идеально. мы сделаем это, попробуем. это извлекает информацию в реальном времени. это добавит ее в эту конкретную электронную таблицу Google. и вот как мы можем извлекать данные из электронных писем, например, неструктурированные данные, такие как данные о потенциальных клиентах, как мы можем автоматически извлекать их из файлов PDF, и все такое. просто пара последних вещей, прежде чем мы закончим. еще одна вещь, которую вы можете сделать, это, скажем, у вас есть все эти входящие лиды, и вы хотите обобщать их каждый день, неделю, месяц, в зависимости от случая. мы можем сделать это, создав здесь новый рабочий процесс. я скрою этот рабочий процесс. мы добавим здесь еще один триггер, и этот триггер будет по расписанию. и вы можете выбрать любой график, может быть, раз в день, раз в неделю, раз в месяц. для этого примера я просто выберу каждый день. и мы хотим извлечь все эти конкретные лиды за день, и мы хотим отправлять это себе или себе через Slack каждый день, или по электронной почте, или как угодно. и мы нажмем кнопку плюс. мы будем искать Gmail. и на этот раз я хочу получить много сообщений. так что теперь мы извлекаем много разных писем из этого почтового ящика. мы извлекаем столько, сколько вы определите. вы можете вернуть все, вы можете ограничить это 50. мы хотим убедиться, что мы отменяем упрощение, чтобы мы могли извлекать текстовое тело этих писем. и кроме этого, я просто хочу добавить фильтр по поиску, который является темой, равной новому лиду. мы не хотим извлекать все письма здесь. например, я не хочу извлекать этот тестовый счет-фактуру. я просто хочу обобщить все эти конкретные лиды здесь. поэтому мы сделаем это. запустим это, и мы получим шесть лидов. теперь, что мы могли бы сделать, это взять эти лиды и отправить их в сообщении. единственная проблема в том, что у нас есть шесть лидов, и если я добавлю сообщение Slack, это отправит шесть сообщений Slack. это не отправит одно сообщение с шестью лидами. это отправит шесть сообщений с шестью отдельными лидами. и поэтому, как здесь сказано, это было запущено один раз. теперь мы получили шесть лидов, и мы запускаем их по отдельности. нам нужно объединить их в одно сообщение. итак, как мы это делаем, это с помощью так называемого агрегатора. и то, что делает агрегатор, это он берет эти отдельные лиды и агрегирует их вместе в одно конкретное сообщение. и я думаю, что лучше всего, если я просто напишу это на этой доске, потому что это как бы уже немного в программировании, ну то есть, немного более продвинутые вещи. это вы, вы идете в продуктовый магазин. хорошо, и в продуктовом магазине у вас есть список того, что нужно купить. один — бананы. номер два — манго. и номер три — яблоки. и вы можете подумать, какого черта вы говорите о продуктовом магазине? какого черта вы говорите о списке покупок? какое это имеет отношение? это список, и список — это причудливый способ сказать, или это простой способ сказать массив. и внутри n8n у вас есть разные типы данных. один — это текст. это как текстовое поле здесь. и у вас может быть список из нескольких вещей. так что этот список может быть списком продуктов в магазине. это может быть список ваших продуктов, бананы, манго, яблоки. вы также можете иметь список лидов. у вас есть Стейси как новый лид, Боб как новый лид, Сара как новый лид. у вас есть список лидов здесь. итак, по сути, как работают эти списки, очень похоже на то, как вы идете в продуктовый магазин. когда вы входите в этот магазин, вы, скорее всего, не начнете с яблок. вы начнете с верха списка. и вы не перейдете к манго или яблокам, пока не вычеркнете первое в списке. так что вы не перейдете к манго, пока не закончите с бананами. и только когда бананы будут отмечены, вы перейдете к манго. но вы еще не перейдете к яблокам, пока не закончите с манго. и только когда манго будет отмечено, вы перейдете к яблокам, и так далее, пока весь ваш список не будет завершен. и почему я говорю это, так это потому, что агрегаторы массивов работают таким же образом. мы не будем продолжать дальше, пока не пройдем все шесть лидов и не добавим их в этот список. так что мы можем пойти дальше, мы можем это протестировать. и у нас есть шесть лидов, которые теперь объединены в один список. если мы откроем это, ну, мы увидим, что ничего не произошло. и это потому, что мы не добавили поле, которое хотим объединить, а это поле для тестирования. но если мы запустим это снова, теперь у нас есть список из шести человек. итак, это все еще список, имейте в виду. агрегатор массивов не изменился, это все еще список из шести потенциальных клиентов, но он больше не отправляет шесть сообщений. теперь он отправляет по одному сообщению за раз. итак, мы могли бы отправить сюда сообщение в Slack. хорошо, так что отправить сообщение. отправить сообщение. и теперь мы можем включить сюда, я просто отправлю сообщение себе, например. я мог бы отправить себе сообщение со всеми этими потенциальными клиентами. так что давайте посмотрим, отправит ли оно. итак, вы видите, что оно не структурировано должным образом. так что это не идеально. как мы можем это изменить, мы могли бы сделать что-то вроде установки или редактирования полей здесь. и мы могли бы сделать отчет о потенциальных клиентах. это название произвольное. вы можете назвать его как угодно. мы можем передать это текстовое поле сюда, и мы изменим его на строку. и когда мы выведем это, это будет выглядеть примерно так. опять же, это далеко не красивый список. я бы не стал отправлять себе такое, но я просто не хочу тратить слишком много времени на детали, занимаясь тем, что я не считаю действительно актуальным для этого видео. и по этой причине я просто оставлю все как есть. но в двух словах, вы могли бы взять весь список, все лиды, объединить их в список, правильно структурировать этот список, отправить себе сообщение, и вот это сообщение здесь, со всей этой информацией в одном месте в одно время. и это довольно полезно, если вы хотите извлекать отчеты из своего почтового ящика. следующая вещь, о которой я хочу поговорить, это не столько автоматизация, сколько то, что я недавно начал делать, и это кардинально изменило правила игры. честно говоря, это может быть полезнее, чем почти все остальное, о чем я говорю здесь. так что я хотел бы на это указать. если вы зайдете в раздел настроек Google Gmail, и мы увидим все настройки, и мы наведем курсор на аккаунты и импорт. у нас есть этот доступ к вашему аккаунту. это, вы можете по сути, вы можете дать доступ виртуальному ассистенту, вы можете дать доступ вашему личному ассистенту или члену вашей команды, чтобы он мог просматривать ваш Gmail и все чистить, отвечать людям, и все такое. и это то, что сэкономило мне так много времени, и я очень благодарен, что сделал это. еще одна вещь, которую вы можете сделать, это добавить, например, метки, например, вы можете добавить метку для вашего личного ассистента, чтобы он просматривал и назначал задачи или электронные письма. и если мы вернемся к нашему конкретному сценарию, вы можете добавить еще один классификатор текста для этого конкретного человека и начать назначать ему вещи напрямую. наконец, и в заключение, сегодня мы рассмотрим, просто вернемся к этому триггеру Gmail. этот триггер Gmail — это то, что называется опросом. теперь, в n8n, я просто хочу определить, что такое опрос, потому что я думаю, что это невероятно полезно знать. и если вы этого не знаете, вы будете недовольны n8n. так вот, с одной стороны — n8n, а с другой стороны — Gmail. этот микрофон как-то неудобно расположен. теперь, что происходит с опросом, это то, что в n8n он отправляет запрос в Gmail и говорит: эй, у тебя есть новая почта? есть ли почта? и если есть почта, он скажет, да, у нас есть почта, и вернет эту почту. но если почты нет, он ее не вернет. так что, скажем, вы отправляете запрос в Gmail, новых писем нет. вы проверили все письма, ничего нового нет. он скажет, эй, у тебя ничего нового. но если есть новое письмо, он его отправит. но в любом случае, вам все равно придется заплатить за одну операцию, что означает, что вы обязаны платить независимо от результата. почему это проблематично, так это потому, что если вы опрашиваете, то есть запрашиваете информацию с определенным интервалом, если вы опрашиваете раз в минуту, то за день вы отправите 1440 запросов. это очень много запросов, потому что в вашем аккаунте n8n у вас всего, если вы начинаете в облаке, 2500 запросов, что означает, что вы израсходуете их примерно за 1,5 дня, и вы потратите 25, э-э, 25 долларов США или евро, или что там, в месяц на что-то, что истечет примерно через полтора дня. итак, это не идеально. тогда возникает вопрос, как это обойти? как мы можем обойти это? если мы посмотрим на цены n8n, перейдем на страницу цен, у них есть этот стартовый пакет, с которого большинство людей начнут, когда они будут пробовать n8n, но это снова ограничивает нас до 2,5 тысяч. мы можем самостоятельно разместить, что бесплатно с оговоркой, используя эту версию для сообщества, и это занимает две-три минуты для настройки. вот два примера. я использую hostinger.com. и мы можем перейти к hostinger n8n. и это вариант, который вы можете настроить за две-три минуты. вы платите меньше, чем n8n, и вы обходите все это. вам не нужно беспокоиться об этих ограничениях. последний — elestio n8n hosting, который очень похож. вы можете настроить его за пару минут здесь. единственное преимущество этого варианта, которого нет у Hostinger, это то, что с Hostinger вам нужно платить сразу за это. с elestio вам нужно платить только за то, что вы используете, что может быть намного экономичнее, если вы не используете n8n так часто. и по этой причине вы можете обойти эти конкретные ограничения, то есть опрос каждую минуту. например, вы могли бы настроить это на каждый день или каждый час, но я просто получаю, например, сотни писем в день лично, и я хочу как можно скорее их разобрать. я не хочу, чтобы они накапливались. так что я хочу, чтобы этот триггер срабатывал чаще. и если вы похожи на меня, вы, вероятно, захотите более высокую частоту, но вы столкнетесь с этим ограничением в планах. и чтобы преодолеть это, да, вам просто нужно зарегистрироваться для самостоятельного хостинга, о чем у меня также есть видео на моем, э-э, на моем YouTube-канале, абсолютно бесплатно для вас, ребята, чтобы посмотреть. но это два варианта. вы также можете выбрать Railway n8n хостинг. это установка в один клик. это три варианта, с которыми вы можете работать прямо сейчас. э-э, но в двух словах, ребята, это все. спасибо большое за просмотр. надеюсь, вы нашли в этом видео что-то ценное. если да, обязательно нажмите кнопку подписки внизу, потому что я уверен, что если вам понравилось это видео, вам, вероятно, понравятся и другие видео, которые постоянно выходят. и если вы хотите узнать больше об автоматизации ИИ, я бы порекомендовал заглянуть в мое сообщество в School, где я помогаю таким же людям, как вы, автоматизировать, э-э, весь их бизнес и помогаю им зарабатывать деньги с помощью автоматизации ИИ. так вот, в двух словах, есть две трансформации, которые я пытаюсь провести с людьми в этом сообществе. номер один — помогаю людям автоматизировать до 80% их бизнеса. я просто отдаю точные схемы, которые я использовал для масштабирования своего бизнеса до семизначных цифр и автоматизации, по сути, увольнения самого себя. и последнее — это помощь людям в создании и масштабировании агентства по автоматизации ИИ. кроме того, здесь есть тонны других неопубликованных видео, которых нет на YouTube. и это, вероятно, те схемы, которые, э-э, были для меня самыми большими движущими силами, те, которые на самом деле экономят мне больше всего времени и приносят больше всего денег. итак, в двух словах, это все. спасибо, ребята, большое. надеюсь, у вас будет прекрасный день, и я с нетерпением жду встречи с вами в следующем видео. большое спасибо. пока-пока.
